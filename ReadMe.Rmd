# Tools to Streamline Geospatial Analysis in R Using ERSI
Geospatial analysis in R uses different terms than those commonly used by ESRI tools. This package seek to provide a more one-to-one mapping of GIS operations in ESRI within R.  <img src="man/figures/HDQLO-03_h120.jpg" align="right" />

## Need
GIS analysis in R uses very different concepts that those familiar to GIS analysts using ERSI tools. Geospatial tools in R named using common ESRI tool names limit GIS professionals from adopting R. 

## Funding
Funding for development and maintenance of `resri` was provided by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) [Ecosystem Management and Restoration Research Program (EMRRP)](https://emrrp.el.erdc.dren.mil). <img src="man/figures/EMRRP_logo_300.png" align="right" />

## Install
To install the `resri` package, install from GitHub using the `devtools` package:

```r
